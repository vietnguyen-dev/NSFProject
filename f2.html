                       <p>Readers of lab reports can be classified as “the technical audience” familiar with the technical material and language. The technical audience 
                            (i.e., engineering faculty, engineers, etc.) are the decision makers, problem solvers, effective team members, and good communicators in a team setting to work with the budget

                            technical knowledge through a student’s lab data presentation, analysis, and interpretation, as well as the lab’s
                            background information such as engineering principles and processes. </p>
                        <p>They also expect clear, concise (briefly conveying important information), error-free, and logically structured

                            lab manual or handout and other sources that describe the methods. After reading this section, the reader should be able to
                            completely reproduce the experiment to verify the results. Details (list of equipment, etc.) may be in the body or as an
                            attachment depending upon desired conciseness of the report.</p>

                        <li> <h4>Discussion: </h4><p>nterprets and contextualizes the lab results. If discrepancies exist, then possible reasons should be discussed.
                            Possible sources of erroneous or unexpected may be discussed. Makes logical appeals using the data shown in the results

                            conclusions from the key findings made from the results and discussion sections. Descriptions of the key findings need to be
                            a direct response to the lab objectives. May suggest improvements to the lab and further investigation/future work. (refer to
