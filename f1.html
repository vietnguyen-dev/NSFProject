                            (i.e., engineering faculty, engineers, etc.) are the decision makers, problem solvers, effective team members, and good communicators in a team setting to work with the budget

                            technical knowledge through a student’s lab data presentation, analysis, and interpretation, as well as the lab’s
                            background information such as engineering principles and processes. </p>
